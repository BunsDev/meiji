# oSushi Spec

oSushi will be Sushiâ€™s new veToken system focused around building sustainability into the SUSHI Token.

## Sushi Gauges

oSushi will recieve 90% of xSushi fee revenues, these fees will be auctioned off for SUSHI which will then be added on top of emissions.

## oSUSHI

### Overview

* oSushi stands for Onsen Sushi and it is a ERC-20 token but non-transferrable.
* With oSUSHI, you can vote for gauge weights to decide which pool will receive more SUSHI and fee emissions.
* Your oSUSHI balance decays linearly every week.
    * Increase amount: If you lock up more SUSHI the unlock time remains the same.
    * Increase period: You can also increase your lock-up period up to a maximum of 4 years, which will decrease the rate at which your oSushi decays.
* You can choose to delegate your oSushi to someone else, but this delegation is one-time and cannot be changed until your vesting term ends
* You can unlock your SUSHI, doing so will impose a penalty of 50%, which will then be distributed through the Gauges as extra emissions.

## GaugeController

### Overview

- GaugeController Maintains a list of all pools eligble for SUSHI emmissions across all chains. Interface for pools should be compliant with Uni V2 Pools and Tridnet Pools.
- oSushi holders can vote in this contract which Pool they believe should recieve emmissions.
- Votes should not be changeable until the next voting period has begun.
- Determines validity of pools by checking factory, oSushi holders can vote to add factories to the eliligiblity list

## LiquidityGauge

### Overview

- LiquidityGauges are responsible for keeping track of votes for a specific pool, and how many emissions should be signaled towards a specific pool.
- Each LiquidityGauge is tied to a pool, which requires users to lock up their LP tokens.
- LiquidityGauge can be registered with GaugeController to be eligble for rewards.
- Liquidity providers need to deposit their LP tokens to the corresponding LiquidityGauge to receive SUSHI rewards.
- LPs can boost up their rewards up to 2.5x by voting for pools in GaugeController using oSUSHI tokens.

### Interface

```solidity
    /**
     * @notice The current amount of LP tokens that addr has deposited into the gauge.
     */
    function balanceOf(address account) external view returns (uint256);

     * @notice Deposit LP tokens into the gauge.
     * Prior to depositing, ensure that the gauge has been approved to transfer amount LP tokens on behalf of the caller.
     * @param _value: Amount of tokens to deposit
     * @param addr: Address to deposit for. If not given, defaults to the caller.

```solidity
    /**
     * @notice The current killed status of the gauge.
     */
    function isKilled() external view returns (bool);
```

## Minter

### Overview

- The Minter contract will have the minting of new SUSHIâ€™s to signaled gauges.
- The Minter contract will be unable to actually facilitate minting of new tokens, so instead a MasterChef adapter will be written. Masterchef will view Minter as the only pool, wiht max boost, and will direct all new SUSHI emissions to the Minter contract, so that it can then re-distribute them.

### Interface

     * @notice The current amount of LP tokens that addr has deposited into the gauge.

     * @notice The amount of currently mintable CRV for addr from this gauge.
     */
    function mintFor(address gauge_address, address _for) external;
```

## Bribe

### Overview

- The Bribe contract auctions off voting power at a rate of SUSHI per vote, allowing people to buy in varying quantities as long as they meet the rate.
- This rate decreases throughout the week in a dutch auction until it is sold out.
- The earned SUSHI is then made immediately avaliable to those whoâ€™ve locked up their SUSHI inside of the Canonical Bribe contract.
